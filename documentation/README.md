# Theatre CMS

Theatre CMS is an open-source content management system (CMS) designed specifically for the performing arts organization  to create a website to market their performances. While the name implies a focus on theatre (as that is my personal area of expertise), the architecture and terminology is suitable for any organization that provides live performances, such as dance troupes, operas, symphonies, etc.

This project is born out of the confluence of three things: my own experiences as a professional actor and musician, my day job as a web developer, and my experience building websites for three different entertainment sector clients _(a theatre, an opera, and a symphony)_. 

Two of those sites were built  from scratch using WordPress&trade;, the other was a collection of HTML pages I created back in the days using Dreamweaver using shared templates. I have always liked the core/plugin/theme architecture of WP, and Theatre CMS, therefore, adopts that pattern as well. It is, however, a completely different implementation designed to address the needs of performing arts organizations specifically. If you have experience with WordPress&trade;, Theatre CMS will definitely feel feel familiar, but much more suited to your business needs right out of the box.

**THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE**. At this time, it is an experiment in current technologies, consumer interest, and creating an open source software project that gains a significant user base. While the code in this repository does work _(for the most part)_, it is not ready for production.
